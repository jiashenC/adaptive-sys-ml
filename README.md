# Adaptive Machine Learning on IoT Devices
This repos serves as a demo for running deep learning neural network models on IoT devices. The goal 
of this demo is to show that with adaptive strategy implemented on IoT devices, the framework is able 
to preserve better data integrity with the similar performance.
